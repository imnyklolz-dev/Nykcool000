Dinosaurs were lizardlike reptiles that roamed Earth for nearly 180 million years. They first appeared roughly 245 million years ago, and most died out by about 66 million years ago. Although people found dinosaur fossils throughout history, they were first identified as belonging to ancient reptilian land-dwellers in the 1800s. At that time the science of paleontology—the study of prehistoric life that involves the analysis of plant and animal fossils—was fairly new. Scientists who study fossils are called paleontologists. British paleontologist Richard Owen introduced the term Dinosauria in 1842. The name dinosaur comes from the Greek words deinos (“terrible” or “fearfully great”) and sauros (“reptile” or “lizard”).

Scientists have discovered and named some 1,000 dinosaur species. New species are found every year as the result of scientific explorations around the world. Scientists have found dinosaur fossils on all the continents, including Antarctica. However, many of the fossils are incomplete, showing only part of the dinosaur. Today scientists use advanced technological methods to help them study the prehistoric animals. An example is radiocarbon dating, which can be used to determine the age of fossils. Still, there are many unknowns about dinosaurs and the environments in which they lived.
